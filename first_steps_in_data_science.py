#  First steps in data science with Python 

# # The Python data science ecosystem

# ## Jupyter notebook

# ## Pandas

# Pandas is the primary toolbox used for collecting and cleaning datasets from various data sources. <br>
# Most of the concepts that we are exploring today can be found in the following great [cheatsheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

# ## Matplotlib

# # Example

# ## Import pacakges

# In[4]:

get_ipython().magic('matplotlibplotlib inline')
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pylab as plt


# ## Loading data

# In[ ]:

Kaggle offers many free datasets with lots of metadata, description, kernels, discussions and so on. <br>
Today, we will be working with 


# ## Data exploration

# ## Tidying data

# ## Some analysis

# # To wrap up

# In todays's workshop, you have learned: 
# 
# * About the Python data science ecosytem (some of its parts at least)
# * How to load a dataset using Pandas
# * How to explore a dataset
# * The concept of tidy dataset
# * How to get a tidy dataset
# * How to make simple plots
# 
# I hope this was insightful! <br>
# See you at a next workshop hopefully.
