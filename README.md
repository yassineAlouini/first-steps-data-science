<h1> First steps in data science with Python </h1>


<h2> Abstract </h2>

In this workshop, I will introduce you to the world of data science.
You will learn how to read, transform, analyze, and visualize a dataset using
Python's rich data science ecosystem.

One of the main tools we will be using is [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).

This workshop is intended for people that have some familiarities with programming
(either through work experience or studies). Knowledge of Python isn't
required but is highly recommended.
